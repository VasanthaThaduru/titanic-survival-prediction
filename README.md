# titanic-survival-prediction
A machine learning project predicting Titanic passenger survival using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.This is my first project which shows 80% accuracy


🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning.

🔹 About the Project

Built with Python and Scikit-learn

Preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling)

Trained data using Logistic Regression model

Evaluated models with accuracy & confusion matrix

Selected the best model for final prediction

🔹 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🔹 Key Learning

End-to-end ML pipeline (data cleaning → model training → evaluation)

Pushing code to GitHub

Understanding how features affect survival

🔹 How to Run
